# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.
- The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for making intelligent moves.
- The game checks for player wins, AI wins, and draws.
- Start a new game at any time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python)
